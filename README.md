# Twitter Sniper Monitor
A simple and open-sourced monitor made for Twitter to check any update from any account you want.
### Usage
- By using my code, I'm expecting you to already have NodeJS installed and an editor like Visual Studio Code. You can use the terminal to initiate the script by simply running `node index.js`. Let me know if you want me to convert it in an executable. 

In the `config.json` file you will need the following inputs:
- Bearer Token
- Discord Webhook
- Twitter Username that you want to monitor (you can run one username per instance)
- Delay in `ms`

### Features 
The program will automatically fetch the following data by standard if you have the Essential package:
- Tweet Handler 
- Tweet Time 
- Tweet Content and Link

If you have instead the Elevated package it will retrieve more information such as:
- Profile Pic
- More to come...

### Issues and Feedback
- Coming Soon!
